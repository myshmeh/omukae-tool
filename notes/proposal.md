# Omukae Tool Proposal

## I. What's Omukae

- an act of following people who liked/retweeted your tweet on Twitter.

## II. The Problems

### 1. Unmanageable Workflow

there is no central place to see all the likes of a particular tweet. the only place you would find who likes what is the notification tab, but the notification of likes are spread all over place.

- redundant click-this-then-that procedures to follow people.
- you can easily forget until whom you omukaed before (as you might not follow certain people for some reason) - risk of missing omukae

### 2. Risk of Missing

as there's no concrete way to figure who liked/retweeted in the past, there's a risk to miss some people to omukae.

- notification tab does not show the entire history of them.

## IV. The Solution

### Omukae List

- list all the people who liked/retweeted by each of your tweets
- clicking one of them would navigate you to the account page (so you can check/follow them)

### Omukae Check

- once you clicked them, they are marked as checked (so you won't miss until whom you did omukae)

## V. The Compromise

### Regarding II-2. Risk of Missing

we cannot ensure that you omukae EVERYONE who liked/retweeted your tweet in the entire history, but only those who appear on the notification tab.
